You are assembling a concise Jac language reference from extracted signatures and examples.

TARGET: 15-20KB reference document optimized for LLM code generation.

STRUCTURE (follow exactly):

# Jac Language Reference

## Syntax & Types
- Primitives, collections, enums
- Control flow (if/for/while/match)
- Functions and lambdas

## Archetypes
- node: graph vertices with state and abilities
- edge: typed relationships between nodes
- walker: mobile computation that traverses graphs
- obj: value objects (like Python classes)
- enum: enumerations

## Graph Operations
- Connect: ++>, <++>, +>:Edge:+>
- Traverse: [-->], [<--], visit
- Filter: [-->(`?Type)](?attr == val)
- spawn, disengage, report

## Abilities & Events
- can with Type entry/exit
- here, self, visitor keywords
- Execution order

## AI Integration
- by llm(), by llm(method=..., tools=...)
- Semantic strings (sem)
- Structured output

## Cloud & API
- jac serve, endpoints
- __specs__ configuration
- WebSocket, async

## Persistence
- save(), commit()
- Permissions: grant, revoke

## Patterns
- 2-3 complete real-world examples

RULES:

1. ONE example per concept - pick the clearest from the extracted examples
2. Signatures MUST be preserved exactly - these are from AST extraction
3. Use inline syntax where possible: `node Name { has x: type; }`
4. NO redundancy - each concept appears once
5. Code examples should be 5-15 lines, complete and runnable
6. Critical keywords MUST appear: ++>, -->, spawn, visit, report, by llm(), with entry

FORMAT:
- Use ## for sections, ### for subsections
- Inline syntax in backticks for short patterns
- Code blocks for complete examples
- Bullet points for lists of operators/keywords

EXAMPLE OUTPUT STYLE:

## Archetypes
`node Name { has attr: type; can ability with Walker entry { } }`
`walker Name { has state: type; can ability with Node entry { visit [-->]; } }`

```jac
node Person {
    has name: str;
    has age: int;
    can greet with Visitor entry {
        print(f"Hello from {self.name}");
    }
}

walker Visitor {
    can visit_person with Person entry {
        print(f"Visiting {here.name}");
        visit [-->];
    }
}

with entry {
    p = Person(name="Alice", age=30);
    root ++> p;
    root spawn Visitor();
}
```
